# AlarmeringDroid-for-Homey

This app gives Homey the ability to respond to messages of the Dutch P2000 network.

What works:

* Basic search abilities (capcode, town, region, etc.)
* Use in flow to trigger anything, e.g. speach so Homey tells you what is happening

What could be better:

* Uses a 1 minute interval for checking. (Near) real time would be a nice feature. We are looking into this.
